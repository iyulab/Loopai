## 🔄 v0.4 - Infrastructure Enhancements (IN PROGRESS)

**Timeline**: Phase 0-13+ (3-4 months)
**Focus**: Foundation refactoring → Production-grade infrastructure capabilities

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL - Phase 0: Foundation Refactoring (BLOCKING)

**Status**: 🚨 Must complete BEFORE all other v0.4 work
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Breaking Changes**: YES - Major version bump to v1.0.0

#### 0.1 Loop App Terminology Refactoring
**Rationale**: Align codebase with conceptual model (CONCEPTS.md). Doing this now prevents rewriting all v0.4 code later.

- [ ] **0.1.1** Phase 0: Infrastructure
  - Create feature branch `refactor/task-to-loop-app`
  - Ensure all tests passing (baseline)
  - Database backup procedures
  - Document API endpoint migration path
  - **Deliverable**: Refactoring infrastructure ready

- [ ] **0.1.2** Phase 1: Core Domain Models
  - Rename: `TaskSpecification` → `LoopAppSpecification`
  - Rename: `ITaskService` → `ILoopAppService`
  - Rename: `TaskService` → `LoopAppService`
  - Update all Core layer tests
  - **Deliverable**: Core domain models refactored

- [ ] **0.1.3** Phase 2: Database Migration
  - Create migration: `Tasks` table → `LoopApps` table
  - Rename columns: `TaskId` → `LoopAppId` across all tables
  - Update DbContext and repositories
  - **Deliverable**: Database schema migrated

- [ ] **0.1.4** Phase 3: API Layer (Breaking Change)
  - Rename: `TasksController` → `LoopAppsController`
  - Change route: `/api/v1/tasks` → `/api/v1/loop-apps`
  - Update all DTOs and validators
  - **Deliverable**: API endpoints refactored

- [ ] **0.1.5** Phase 4: Client SDKs (Breaking Change)
  - Update .NET SDK: `taskId` → `loopAppId` parameters
  - Update Python SDK: `task_id` → `loop_app_id` parameters
  - Update TypeScript SDK: `taskId` → `loopAppId` parameters
  - **Deliverable**: All SDKs v1.0.0-alpha

- [ ] **0.1.6** Phase 5: Integration Tests
  - Update all integration test scenarios
  - Cross-SDK compatibility validation
  - **Deliverable**: All tests passing

- [ ] **0.1.7** Phase 6-7: Documentation & Release
  - Update ARCHITECTURE.md, DEPLOYMENT.md
  - Create MIGRATION_V0_TO_V1.md guide
  - Version bump: v0.3.x → v1.0.0
  - **Deliverable**: v1.0.0 released

**Estimated Duration**: 13-19 days (2-3 weeks)
**Reference**: See [REFACTORING_PLAN.md](docs/REFACTORING_PLAN.md) for detailed phase breakdown
