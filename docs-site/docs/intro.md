Loopai is a **program synthesis and execution framework** that transforms natural language specifications into executable programs. It provides infrastructure for building adaptive AI-powered applications with multi-language support and complete data sovereignty.

## What is Loopai?

Instead of making repeated calls to language models, Loopai generates programs once and executes them locally with low latency and complete data control.

### Core Capabilities

- **Multi-Language SDKs**: .NET, Python, TypeScript
- **Low Latency Execution**: Fast local program execution
- **Data Sovereignty**: Execute on your own infrastructure
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing
