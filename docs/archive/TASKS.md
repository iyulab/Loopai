### Risk Management

**Technical Risks**:
- **Risk**: LLM API changes break integration
  - **Mitigation**: Abstract LLM interface, version pinning, extensive testing
- **Risk**: Generated programs have security vulnerabilities
  - **Mitigation**: Sandboxing, static analysis, security audits
- **Risk**: Cost optimization doesn't achieve targets
  - **Mitigation**: Early benchmarking, conservative promises, transparent reporting

**Business Risks**:
- **Risk**: Market adoption slower than expected
  - **Mitigation**: Free tier, open-source core, community building
- **Risk**: Competitors enter market
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on quality, enterprise features, customer success
- **Risk**: Regulatory challenges
  - **Mitigation**: Early compliance work, legal consultation, flexible architecture
